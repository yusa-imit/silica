Perform a code review on current changes.

Steps:
1. Run `git diff` to see unstaged changes
2. Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
3. If no changes, check `git diff HEAD~1` for the last commit
4. For each changed file:
   a. Read the full file for context
   b. Review changes against the checklist:
      - Correctness: Does the logic match PRD requirements?
      - Database Integrity: B+Tree invariants? Page checksums? WAL correctness?
      - Safety: No memory leaks, no buffer overflow, no UB?
      - Quality: Follows Zig conventions? Clean code?
      - Tests: Are there tests for new/changed functionality?
      - Performance: Unnecessary allocations? O(n^2) in hot paths?
5. Report findings as CRITICAL / WARNING / SUGGESTION

Context: $ARGUMENTS (optional description of what to focus on)
